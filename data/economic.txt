Real GDP
GDP per capita

Essential economic Indicators:


1. Economic Growth —> GDP
   GDP = C+ I + G + (X-M)
  C: personal consumption   I : Investment
  G: Govt spending  X: Export  M: Imports Nominal GDP growth% - Inflation% = Real GDP growth%


 2. Inflation 
2 sources of Inflation data  PCE: Personal Consumption Expenditure report CPI : Consumer price Index




3. Unemployment


  Increase in unemployment depresses GDP numbers  Main indicator: Nonfarm payrolls




4. Business Confidence PMI: Purchasing Managers index 
5. Housing: housing starts.   Monitoring GDP:

Movement in Yield Curve:


Long term yield: Influenced by  - Interest rate forecast
- Long term GDP growth estimate
- Demographics
- demand for long term borrowing
- supply of long term lending
- Inflation expectations — negative effect on long term interest rates


Premium    : Difference in yield between 10 yr bonds and 3 month bonds.. When the premium is negative - yield curve is inverted- an omen for deflation




 
Currency:


Yield Differential: Cur with higher interest rate yield attracts greater currency inflow  Bond yield differential: Difference between 2/10 year bond yield between 2 countries
What affects Currency valuation: Changes in Interest rate, Inflation, Trade
